### Summary
 *: An application for showing data progressions
 *: Import or add however many lines of data as you wish
 *: Custom configuration settings for each algorithm
 *: Easy to export/import correct file format
 
### Summary

The goal of this project is for students and beginning professionals in AI to have a visual understanding of the
inner workings of the fundamental algorithms. AI is a vast field, and this project is limited to the visualization
of two types of algorithms that “learn” from data. These two types are called clustering and classification. The
design and development of these algorithms is outside the scope of the project, and the assumption is that such
algorithms will already be developed independently, and their output will comply with the data format specified
in this document. DataViLiJ serves simply as a visualization tool for how those algorithms work. Both clustering
and classification are, in theory, not limited to a fixed number of labels for the data, but this project will be
limited to at most four labels for clustering algorithms, and exactly two labels for classification algorithms.
Further, the design and development of this project will also assume that the data is 2-dimensional.
 

Upon startup, the application will look something like the following
