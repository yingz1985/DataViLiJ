# DataViLiJ
data visualization project

Given the increasing importance of data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) in many aspects of computer science,
visualizing how AI algorithms work is becoming increasingly important. Java is among the most important
programming languages used to implement these algorithms, but it lacks standard data visualization libraries
(unlike some other languages such as Python). Moreover, all existing libraries are meant to show us the final
output of the data science algorithms. They are not designed for visualizing the changes that happen while the
algorithms are running and updating the data. In other words, the visualization libraries do not help us see how
these algorithms learn from the data. 

DataViLiJ (Data Visualization Library in Java) will be a desktop application that will allow users to select an
algorithm (from a set of standard AI algorithms) and dynamically show the user what changes, and how.
